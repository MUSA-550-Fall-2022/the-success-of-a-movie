For this project, we would like to discover the significant factors that contribute to the general success of a movie. We will be looking at the relationship between the gross box office/revenue and features like movie genre, Oscars nominations/award, reviews, soundtrack ratings, and trailer popularity.

The data analysis and machie learning were based on the following datasets:  

Oscars data, ["_The Oscar Award, 1927 - 2020_" ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award).
          
YouTube trailers, ["_MovieLens 20M_"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m-youtube/).
          
scraped Movie soundtrack data from ["_MOVIE WAVE_"](http://www.movie-wave.net/reviews-by-title/).
